Brenda-Files

Description: This project takes an existing directory of any number of files and shortens the "tree." The root directory - the folder every other folder and file is in - stays the same, as does the file name and extension.

Example:

"Z:\main_folder\another folder\Russian nesting doll\yadda yadda\investment board report.xlsx"

Becomes:

"Z:\main_\anoth\Russi\yadda\investment board report.xlsx"
