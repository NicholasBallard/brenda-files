Brenda-Files

Description: This project takes an existing directory of any number of files and shortens the "tree." The root directory - the folder every other folder and file is in - stays the same, as does the file name and extension.

Example:

"Z:\main_folder\another folder\Russian nesting doll\yadda yadda\investment board report.xlsx"

Becomes:

"Z:\main_\anoth\Russi\yadda\investment board report.xlsx"

In the terminal output when done, the program prints the new longest directory length versus the longest directory length of the original folder.

Steps:

1 ==>> Make sure to work on a copy of the folder, not the original! Just in case...

2 ==>> Set the working directory for Brenda's computer. Copy the Z:\\ ("the Z Drive") to the desktop. The program will make yet another copy of this folder just in case, and work off that.
